Hey! I'm @Narmada (Narmada Nettem) ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer from New Zealand

Passionate and experienced IT professional with a proven track record in software development, HRIS analysis, and quality assurance. My journey in the IT industry began with a test automation course, which laid the foundation for my skills and determination to succeed. Over the past two years, I've pursued advanced courses through Mission Ready, gaining practical experience and honing my skills as a Software Developer and HRIS Analyst.

At Nodero, I served as an HRIS Analyst, where I focused on innovating user-centric software solutions. I utilized the Technology One platform along with Power BI, DAX, ETL, and SQL to develop and maintain applications that enhanced functionality and user experience. Contributing to technical designs, I facilitated the seamless integration of front-end and back-end services, enhancing application responsiveness and user experience. My commitment to agile methodologies ensured meticulous documentation and defect resolution, underpinned by my ISTQB certification.

During my time at DoorKnock, I developed full-stack web applications, working closely with product and QA teams to test, debug, and deploy high-quality software solutions. As an intern at MVP Studio, I conducted manual and automated testing for web and mobile applications, contributing to the continuous improvement of testing strategies.

I am currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my expertise and continue creating impactful technology solutions. With a proactive attitude and a passion for learning, I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and drive success.
