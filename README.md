Hey! I'm @Narmada (Narmada Nettem) ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer from New Zealand

I currently live in Palmerston North, NZ.

I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems, in New Zealand. ðŸŒŽ


I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to FastAPI, Typer, and my other open source projects.
